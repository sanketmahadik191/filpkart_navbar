### Blue Navbar Portion

**Description:** The blue navbar portion at the top of the page is created using HTML and CSS. Here's how it's structured:

- The Flipkart logo is displayed using an `<img>` element with the `logo` class.
- The search bar is created with an `<input>` element for the search box and a `<div>` for the search icon. CSS properties such as `flex`, `justify-between`, and `items-center` are used to align these elements.
- The "Login" button and "Become a Seller" link are styled with CSS properties like `background-color`, `color`, `font-weight`, and `padding`.
- The "More" dropdown section is designed with a `<div>` containing the "More" label and an expand icon.
- The shopping cart icon is displayed using an expand icon from Google's Material Icons library.

### White Navbar Portion

**Description:** The white navbar portion below the blue section contains various product categories, each with an icon and label. Some categories have an expand icon for subcategories. Here's how it's structured:

- Each category is enclosed in a `<div>` element with a specific class for styling.
- Inside each category `<div>`, there is an `<img>` element for the category icon and a `<p>` element for the label.
- Categories with subcategories have an additional expand icon next to the label.
- CSS properties such as `display`, `flex`, and `gap` are used to organize and style these elements.
